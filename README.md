Getting a speeding ticket is a nuisance.

Navigating the legal options of what you can do after you get cited is even more of a nuisance, especially if you were...

- Cited in an area that you are not local to (i.e one of the many small desert counties policed by CHP while driving through I-5)
- Cited in a high-population/popular/swamped county (i.e San Francisco Superior Court) where traffic court is the least of their concerns
- Have to work and don't have the time to spend entire day waiting in court  
- Don't have acess/money to lawyers to contest a speeding ticket
- Tried reading through any of the various state court websites to find the information confusing/indigestible

This app would be an idiotproof DIY, self-serve, incremental 1/2/3/4/5...step process for those navigate what to do after they get cited, specifically:

- Instructions for how to contest the ticket (in-person or via mail, if they choose)
- What they can do to rectify the points on their driving records

Starting with static pages and CA alone, since that's where my knowledge (technical/non-technical) is bound to as of now.
